### Why is this important?

Although non-essential travel should be avoided, some individuals must continue to travel during this time. Often, the journey itself is where an infection can be transferred. Many forms of travel that would normally be deemed safe involve contact with many people. If you do need to travel, this guide will help you minimize your risk of contracting or spreading the virus.

### Modes of Transport

#### Personal Vehicle (Car or Motorbike)

Refer to [T7: Prepare to Leave the Household](/f1-preparing-for-coronavirus-lock-down.html#t7_prepare-to-leave-the-household) before you embark on your journey.

- If travel cannot be avoided, minimize contact with others
  - Ideally, trips should be made alone

Disinfecting

- Disinfect hands before entering the car
  - If this cannot be done, disinfect all surfaces you touch before and after a journey (steering wheel, gearstick, handbrake, door handles, indicators/windshield wipers, radio, elbow rests, door frame, seat controls)
  - Exterior door handles, door frame, and luggage compartment handles should also be disinfected before and after a journey
- Disinfect all surfaces touched by other passengers
  - Door handles (outside and inside), window controls, seat controls, elbow rest, door frame

Taking Passengers

- Ensure as few passengers travel in one vehicle at a time
- Obtain contact details from all passengers
- If one passenger may have come into contact with an infected individual, they should wear a mask
- Opening the windows may reduce the likelihood infection, especially between taking passengers

Filling Up with Fuel

- Minimize contact with staff
- Try and use contactless payment at the pump if possible
- Disinfect your hands before re-entering your vehicle

<br>

#### Taxi

- Wear a mask and encourage the driver to do the same
- Minimize contact with surfaces inside and outside the car
  - If surfaces are touched, avoid touching your face until your hands are disinfected
- Disinfect your hands when entering and leaving the taxi
- Travel alone or only with members of your household only, if possible

<br>

#### Walking and Biking

- Keep more than 2m/6ft between yourself and other people
- Avoid busy routes to minimize contact with others

<br>

#### Mass Transit and Public Transport

**Rail, Bus, Tram, Coach**

<u>Entering</u>

- Avoid crowded trains and buses
  - Whenever possible, leave 2m/6ft between other passengers
  - Travel at off peak times if possible; consider arriving at work early if you need to travel during peak hours and cannot avoid busy transport during this time
- Take another form of transport (e.g. biking) if you need to take multiple buses/trains to your destination
- Pay with a contactless form of payment if possible, rather than bus tickets or train tokens

<u>Riding</u>

- Avoid touching any surfaces or sitting next to coughing individuals
- Wear a N95 mask, surgical mask, or home-made mask if possible, especially on busy buses/trains

<u>Leaving</u>

- Wash or disinfect hands as soon as possible after leaving; avoid touching your face until you have done so

#### Aircraft

**Currently, the State Department is recommending that U.S. citizens avoid all international travel. If a traveler is a member of the essential services, and has special dispensation to fly, follow the guidance you will have been given.**

- All non-essential air travel should be avoided, particularly long plane rides.
  - The greatest risk comes from exposure an individual who is carrying the virus, or their infected droplets from sneezing, coughing, talking or breathing in your vicinity (HEPA filters may decrease the chance of infection, if used appropriately and according to manufacturer and OSHA/CDC/NIOSH specifications)
- Disinfect all surfaces using disinfecting wipes
- If a nearby passenger is coughing, ask to switch seats
  - If this cannot be done, avoid touching your face and continually disinfect surfaces
- More time spent in crowded places (i.e. plane, airport) increases one's chance of catching COVID-19

<br>

#### Cruise Ships

- Disease can spread quickly inside the close quarters of a cruise ship, as has occurred in several cases already.
- The CDC advises against any travel on a cruise ship, particularly for those at higher risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19.
